# Super Extra Challenges 

## Fibonacci Challenge

The fibonacci sequence is a mathematical sequence of integers. By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ..

Define a function called `fibonacci` with a single argument `n` The function should return the nth number of the fibonacci sequence.

Hint: Use a _recursive_ function

## String Calculator

Define a function called `add` with a single argument `input`. The input to the function will be a string containing a comma-separated list of numbers. The function must return the sum of the numbers. e.g.

    add(1,2,3,4) // => 10


## Reverse Number 

Write a JavaScript function that reverse a number

    Example x = 32243;
    Expected Output : 34223 

## Is palindrome?

Write a JavaScript function that checks whether a passed string is palindrome or not
A palindrome is word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam or nurses run.

## String combinations 

Write a JavaScript function that generates all combinations of a string

    Example string : 'dog' 
    Expected Output : d,do,dog,o,og,g 

## Sort letters

Write a JavaScript function that returns a passed string with letters in alphabetical order

    Example string : 'webmaster' 
    Expected Output : 'abeemrstw'

Assume punctuation and numbers symbols are not included in the passed string.

## Uppercase First Letter

Write a JavaScript function that accepts a string as a parameter and converts the first letter of each word of the string in upper case

    Example string : 'the quick brown fox' 
    Expected Output : 'The Quick Brown Fox '

## Longest Word

Write a JavaScript function that accepts a string as a parameter and find the longest word within the string

    Example string : 'Web Development Tutorial' 
    Expected Output : 'Development'

## How many vowels

Write a JavaScript function that accepts a string as a parameter and counts the number of vowels within the string
Note : As the letter 'y' can be regarded as both a vowel and a consonant, we do not count 'y' as vowel here. 

    Example string : 'The quick brown fox' 
    Expected Output : 5

## Is prime

Write a JavaScript function that accepts a number as a parameter and check the number is prime or not
Note : A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

## What type 

Write a JavaScript function which accepts an argument and returns the type
Note : There are six possible values that typeof returns: `object`, `boolean`, `function`, `number`, `string`, and `undefined`.
